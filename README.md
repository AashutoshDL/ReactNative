Sticker Mash App

Sticker Mash is a simple mobile application built using React Native and Expo. This app allows users to select images from their gallery, add fun stickers to them, and save the edited images to their device. The project serves as an introduction to React Native development, focusing on basic concepts such as state management, component-based architecture, and integrating native device features like image picking and saving.
